In my field in computer graphics it is less competitive but still more than average competition in the whole academia.","It is better to practice meditation in a community. This way, not only can we share insights with each other, but also the influence of the collective mindfulness energy can help us sustain our practice.
Questions and ideas shared in a group can become part of the collective store consciousness. So sometimes, a question asked somewhere might find its answer from the mouth of someone else at a later time.",NA,NA,"My work aligns closely with my academic skills and interests.

Lack of supervision and connection.
Academic challenges.","I have some level of passion, curiosity, and sense of responsibility in my work. I also have concern about how to practice mindful working but stay optimistic about it.",NA,"1.  Mindfulness energy can be accumulated whenever we are doing anything while staying mindful about doing it.
2. Our minds are obsessed with questioning and thinking. Sometimes the answer to ultimate questions in life is to simply live in the present moment and taking good care of our body.","Compassion is a fundamental wholesome mental formation that waters the flower of love and sense of belonging in a community. It helps people connect with each other on a deeper level. When we practice deep listening, the idea is to be present with a fully embracing attitude with the person, and to listen to the voice and the heart of the soul.
Resiliency can be developed simply through entering the present moment. If we find our arrival in every moment, we are no longer entangled with fear, worry, concern of the past or the future. So that way, we seem ""resilient"" to the existing problems while freeing ourselves from sufferings.","I had a question on how to integrate the spirits of the Buddhist mindfulness practice into the way we cope with technology advancement, since I work in the field of computer science.
I was bothered by the fast pace and growing competition of my field, and disliked more and more scientific work coming out of the unwholesome publication game.
After the retreat, I think I have found the answer, but it cannot really be explained by words. To conclude briefly, I think if we can find harmonies within ourself and live a lifestyle under the ethics training we received in the retreat, our scientific work will be a wholesome fruit to the human knowledge by nature.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Thank you for your organization in this amazing retreat. I just would like to bring the factor of cultural differences to our vision. As a Chinese mainlander who studied in Europe for 4 years and can speak fluent English, I still constantly felt sense of excluding from my Dharma family and general social interactions. I sensed fear, stress, and increased level of politeness with western people that I interacted with. So conversations often ended quickly. However, I had no such trouble socializing with local people when I study in Netherlands. So I believe there is some misunderstanding and misinterpretation of our differences in talking and behaving during the retreat. This discomfort was also expressed by several other Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese people I spoke to.
I would love Plum Village to take into account the experience of minority cultural groups in the future, such as creating different language groups and promoting cross-cultural communication (my university has done so to facilitate collaboration in a very diversed student community). This can not only foster a more trusting and open community, but also enrich the retreat itself since China has a profound ancient history with Buddhism and mindfulness practices.",NA

Participant 8,"pre, post",46,Man,"Graz, Austria",White or European descent,"Business, Information Technology, Science & Research","I'm originally trained in physics, but now working in the digital marketing and IT sector. My interaction with ""Science and Research"" continues mainly through developing the ""Mindful Researchers"" initiative, supporting various ESRI events by Mind & Life Europe, etc.",I'm affiliated with the Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education (IGDORE),Very Experienced (5+ Years),"meditation (mainly Vipassana style, some Metta meditation), reflective journaling",No,Yes,MSC course,Yes,"mostly Vipassana retreats, some Metta retreats, some Shamatha retreats with B. Alan Wallace, one ""Level 1"" retreat with Daniel P. Brown",No,Yes,"I live close to the northern outskirts of my city. There are little parks around, the river that flows across the city is within a 5-10 minutes walk. Even closer there is a little stream of water (sometimes dry, depending on rain) where I have a ""favourite spot"" beneath one of the trees, where I love to touch the ground with my hands and listen to the sounds of the water. Within 15-20 minutes walk I can reach a little wood and a sacred cave with a well, where I sometimes go to pray. I used to go intentionally to these places more often, a few times per week. Recently it's a lot less, perhaps once per week. I cycle along the river on my way to work about 3-5 times a week. And recently my partner and I have started to go on a hike in the mountains (at car's distance of about 30-60 minutes) each weekend. We also have a large garden with a rather steep slope at her parent's house in which we do various kinds of gardening work, often very intensive, about 2-4 times per month. So I consider myself very blessed for easy access to nature in many ways.",NA,"1. In my ""day job"" in the realm of digital marketing, while we mostly work individually on our tasks, occasionally some team members check in with each other around current questions, challenges, etc. with usually a sense of good collaboration, really trying to help each other solve problems and to learn. 
2. Working on the ""Mindful Researchers"" initiative feels more collaborative, many activities and tasks are tackled together (synchronously or asynchronously), we plan and co-facilitiate online events together, etc. – the themes of ""collaboration"" and ""community"" are strongly woven into the fabric of the initiative.","1. In my ""day job"" in the realm of digital marketing, competition mainly centers on trying to do a better job with higher quality than our competitors (e.g. when one of our clients is unsure whether they want to work on something with us or with a competitor), and also by trying to deliver better results for our clients vis-à-vis their competitors. Occasionally we also ""compete against deadlines"", e.g. when there is a technical change in the digital marketing frameworks used that requires us to implement solutions for many of our customers within a limited timeframe.
2. Working on the ""Mindful Researchers"" initiative feels more like competing with the ""status quo"" of research culture, e.g. trying to offer alternatives ourselves, or supporting people and groups who wish to develop such alternatives themselves. It seems more a competition with ""what does not yet exist"" and trying to bring it into existence, to fill a niche (for instance, by fostering bottom-up and participatory approaches and stimulating innovation processes in the field of contemplative research).","It becomes much easier to collaborate in a ""contemplative environment"". The presence of monastics, the Sangha, all of it inspires generosity, compassion, and the wish to collaborate.","Collaboration among work colleagues, we're eager to help each other out. There is not too much socializing but to some (smaller) extent we also share more personal things.","Competition mainly to the outside: there are competitors in the form of other digital marketing agencies, so we need to do good work with our clients in order to remain in contract. And we do things that help our clients in their competitive environments.","I sometimes feel as though I am ""not doing enough"", coming from a relatively privileged and empowered position – I live in Austria, I have a PhD title, I am intelligent, quite healthy, I have a job that allows me flexibility to work also on other things, etc. ... Even though I am trying to contribute to a better society, peace, life, nature, e.g. through the Mindful Researchers initiative, there are so many areas that call for attention and engagement. Should I not try to support climate research? Work directly on social or environmental issues in my paid job? Become politically active? Build community and mutual support in my neighbourhood? ... But I am limited in many ways, right?
Economically speaking, I am working only 25 hours per week in my paid job, which is enough to pay the bills and allows me the luxury to work (almost) for free e.g. for the Mindful Researchers initiative, but way less income than what people with my background would typically make. So I'm not getting wealthy in the economic sense, which also means that my capacity to share financial wealth (by donations, sponsorship etc.) is limited.
In sum, I often have mixed feelings, oscillating between ""is this enough?"" and a nagging sense of urgency, wondering if I am ""doing what I am supposed to be doing"" – but there are certainly psychological factors at play too (e.g. the inner child tries to become worthy and ""win the love"" of a forever absent father, who abandoned our family when I was only a few years old?).
Sorry if I am digressing! I hope you can make sense of my response. :-)","Oh, this theme is very close to my heart, I could write a lot about it! It is basically the reason why I started the ""Contemplative Scientific Collaboration"" project in 2016, and together with others the ""Mindful Researchers"" initiative in 2020. Maybe it's easiest if I just send you the links here, and I would also be happy to get in touch, during or outside the retreat, if you'd like! 
https://www.contemplativecollaboration.org/
https://mindfulresearchers.org/","It feels more purposeful and also more simplified. There is a stronger sense of purpose to which I can connect my work and various engagements, seeing how they contribute to that purpose. And there is a clearer sense of what is not contributing, or not connected, or would lead me away from it, and now it feels much easier to say ""no"" to these things and to choose with confidence what to say ""yes"" to. There is a growing sense of alignment.","I'm relating to my ""bread job"" in digital marketing here. I don't think this work has a particularly positive impact on social, economic or environmental realities - except in the cases where our clients' businesses are socially and environmentally responsible and we can help them thrive. So this feels rather ""neutral"" to me and perhaps lacking something – I feel I could do more for the sake of social, economic, and environmental well-being. By contrast, I consider my voluntary work with the ""Mindful Researchers"" initiative far more meaningful and potentially conducive to a positive impact, although also rather indirectly as a kind of amplifier or incubator for people's ideas, initiatives and shared practices. It's great to see people being engaged in the world, whether small or large scale, and to support them or to help them find support. This gives me more of a ""positive"" feeling.","There were so many, but right now I distinctly remember these two:

1) In the ""Beginning Anew"" exercise, when considering the person I had chosen, I thought ""oh, this will never work!"", but then I was surprised at how ""easy"" the exercise went. It also shifted something in my relationship with that person.

2) I was impressed with the way in which one of the participant-volunteers guided us during the service meditation: clear instructions, bringing a lot of joy, and there was one moment in which he beautifully apologised for having felt rushed (which I hadn't even noticed!) and re-committed to bringing mindfulness and joy to our service work. I found this way of showing up very moving and inspiring.","Cultivating compassion, and being in a environment in which compassion is being cultivated together, feels very supportive and increases resiliency, both immediate and long-lasting.","I feel more strongly than before that a monastic environment, a Sangha, etc. – especially with the openness for sharing and exchange that I have experienced at Plum Village – can provide fruitful conditions for people to strengthen their practice as well as their resolve to respond skillfulls to any kind of challenge, including what we refer to as ""global challenges"". In some sense, everyone becomes a mutual supporter and contributor to responding more skillfully to global challenges, even if we don't tackle them directly in our respective daily lives.",Yes,"Mindfulness bell, short breathing meditation / walking meditation, mindful eating","Yes. Some significant changes in primary relationships, taking better care of my living space, and being more focused at work.","Thank you very much for your work, and good luck! I'm glad you are taking it on, and happy to learn more about it as time unfolds. _/\_","Again and always, thank you for your precious work! May it flourish, and may you and all beings flourish. :-)",Thank you for doing this work! I look forward to seeing the results someday. :-)

However, collaboration can be great when the objective is well understood, that is, the best outcome for patients.","My saddest discovery was competition between non-profit organizations. It happens particularly when some leaders seem to have a ""big ego"". Difficult to collaborate or discuss new ideas. In the medical community, I find it difficult to discuss new or alternative concepts about disease(s). Competition sometimes means to dismiss these ideas or to ""put down"" those who hold them.

People are punished when they take longer time to achieve something or when they want to follow another path that is not the standard (e.g. master student, PhD student, postdocs, some kind of professorship, etc.). Funding is also given mostly to younger people or recent graduates. So there is a race to do everything fast and without showing a hint of doubt. It is difficult to be consider for a position when there are gaps in the CV.","* Maybe not directly related, but I feel now that community is very important in my development and probably in the development of anything. That we can see through the eyes of others and understand ourselves in a deeper way. 

* Maybe also that collaboration in science is possible in a way that helps growing everybody and that is not about making the others small.

* The idea that we can be ourselves and acknowledge our human nature even in spaces where we are expected to be productive.","Within a research group there is support from the PI but also from other members of the group. We share ideas, code, give constructive feedback to the others.","There are few positions to be filled, so there is always a lot of competition to find a position, people need to be overqualified to be underpaid. Often people need to work for free to have the chance to gain experience. Excellence and fast and smooth careers are ""required"" by research groups, laboratories, universities, and there is not much space for people that take things slowly or don't follow a ""straight"" path.","It is difficult because I need to sit myself to work in front of the computer the whole day and I basically don't have any contact with anybody, I feel my supervisor is not interested in my work, I rely only on self-motivation to do stuff, but I get discouraged very easily. I feel disconnected and also feel that I waste my time, because I don't feel it is helping me nor others. The economic part is also difficult, it does not reflect all the efforts I do and that should be compensated.","I think I feel constant pressure to perform, always have to work more than what I am hired for or what would give me a more balance life, I feel I need to prove myself constantly, I get very anxious related to uncertainty of my future given offers are almost always short term, I feel it is sometimes difficult to accept that some research is done that likely won't improve anybody's lives but that involve experimenting with animals, I feel I am constantly in a race, I get very stressed and anxious because of deadlines, and also because I am always asked to do more (to explore other options, methods, parameters, etc.) and sometimes it feels like my supervisor is never happy or that my projects are never going to end, I feel the pressure of not being prepare for the opportunities that I would like to access to and that if I don't take them or can't take them now then there won't be opportunities later.","At the moment I am working on my master thesis, which does not really help to solve any problem and also does not provide a lot of room to discuss or interact with people, that is why I don't feel that happy with it. But anyways I feel the need to finish it to be able to continue in research and maybe work on something that can be more useful or help others in some way.","Right now I am doing an internship at a research group and there I feel very welcomed. I feel very much supported by my advisor and feel he is interested in the project advancing but also in me learning and understanding what we are doing. This internship gives structure to my day and when I know what to do I can work very focused, but when I don't understand certain things and when my code fails, it is difficult to stay calm, and sometimes I feel overwhelmed. This project has to do with fMRI and could give some light in how to use this kind of data to help predict the likelihood of having certain diseases, so I hope it is helpful afterwards. But sometimes the work is very abstract and I wonder if I could do something more direct to help animals or people. I do feel concerned about our planet earth, all the suffering we are causing to animals, the nature we are destroying, and also the unhappiness that I see sometimes in people, so I would like to help in a more direct way, but I do not know how to start.","* The idea that my body can guide me through my questions and inquiries; in the sense that I don't necessarily have to analyze everything in detail, but that somehow my body also knows what is best for me and I can listen to it and get some insight from it. 

* The theory that the mind is creating a model of the world, so that everything that we perceive/sense/think depends on our previous experiences and our current model of the world. The idea that my believes and intentions really have an impact in my everyday life. The fact that fear can block the update of the model. The idea that I am always looking through some lenses and that I have the power to choose which lenses I want to see through.",* Maybe the idea that I can take the time I need to feel well and that everyday I need spaces of rest to be able to offer calm and compassion in spaces where I need to be productive or work with others. To be compassionate with myself not putting pressure on myself to perform or to do things fast.,"I had been in other retreats in PV before and the idea of working on myself first to then be able to help with some energy that has the qualities of patience and compassion had been mentioned already. But this time I could really feel this, maybe it had a time too sink too; so I really understand that for me to be able to help in anyway to solve the global challenges, I need first to solve the inner wars within myself.",Yes,"Eating meditation, walking meditation, sitting meditation","This is my third retreat in Plum Village and I can say that this time I have been able to give better continuity to the mindful practices at home, I meditate more frequently and also read and watch talks of Thay or of the PV community in general. The retreat helped me a lot to deal with my anxiety.",NA,"I just want to express my gratitude to everybody and everything that made the retreat possible. It was an awesome experience for me and I learned a lot! I have always been very interested in how the mind works and from some time ago (due to me being depressed) really interested in how to bring well-being to my life and others' life and in meditation and buddhist practices, which was nicely intertwined in the retreat :) 

And for the sake of transparency/comparability I must say that there is a confounder related to my slightly negative answers in the pre-retreat survey; I had my period then and that really affects me sometimes, making it a bit difficult to stay in a good mood. And I realize my answers now are more positive, which definitely depends on the effect the retreat had in me, and also the volunteering during this time, which brings me a lot of peace and calm right now, but I think it is also related to me not having my period right now. So I am making your job a bit more difficult, sorry :)

","This survey makes me question how I can work in a more healthy way and how my work can also contribute to my sense of well being. I will try to stay mindful when I work, but I will also do my best to find a job that is more meaningful to me. Thanks for your guidance."

I found it incredibly interesting to witness the interweaving of buddhist practice, psychology and philosophy with Western Science - where it went well, where there was friction and how the space was given for that friction to unravel, both in the community and in myself. I learned a lot from the retreat, but not necessarily in the sessions that I expected - I learned more from the dharma sharing family, the affinity dinner, and the casual talks with other participants than the science talks (although I also learned a lot from those). But the space given to those (to me) less conventional moments of sharing was the most generative.",NA,NA,NA,"I am currently in a transition phase where i am sort of questioning my role as an artist in society, how I can survive moving into “middle age” and how I can be best of service to the world. In my work I often collaborate with scientists, and find the interdisciplinary collaboration across art and science important. But I am not sure how to make this also sustainable as work and practice yet. These are questions I hope I will encounter and meditate on during the retreat as well.","(I assumed the above multiple choice options were to reflect how i feel after the retreat vs before) I still feel confused about my direction in life - ie. the concerns I had before the retreat are still there, but I feel less hopeless and less suffering from the issues I face. I am trying to integrate the new perspectives and practice I gained from the retreat to find my way towards a clearer aspiration in life (which will hopefully also bring about more wholesome social, economic and environmental realities).",NA,"I feel like I understand the practice (not only of meditating, but of being part of a buddhist practice/lineage/etc) better. I have done ""mindfulness without the buddhism"" through therapy in the past, done my own meditation (as a remedy for mental health), but for the first time after the retreat I feel a sense of larger purpose (?) and meaning that goes beyond the 'remedy' idea, and actually makes me feel (surprise) good! part of a community! that there's hope and meaning to be found on this crazy journey! So that's pretty much the best thing one could wish for!","I'm just blown away by the whole organizational structure, reach and community of Plum Village. I'm amazed that this movement is (seemingly, from my first encounter) such a healthy, flourishing, compassionate and resilient community - I think capitalism and indvidualism had tricked me into thinking that this isn't possible, that a movement this big would be 'cultish' or unhealthy in some way. I've been proven wrong. Now, after the retreat, I hope to join a local or online sangha, and feel that I have a potentially life-long commitment to the practice, which will help me overcome issues in my personality, and issues in my communities, that I felt were unsolvable.","Yes! It gave me hope. I realized I had come into the event rather cynically, about my own abilities to transform, as well as for the world to transform into a more just place (or even a place where we and other species can survive). Meeting so many passionate and compassionate people, who work so hard on trying to make a difference in the world, even when it feels seemingly impossible, was heartening. The ''Begin Anew"" practice, as well as the profound insight of what happens when we learn to take care of our own emotions before we encounter the world, gave me hope in terms of collaboration on global challenges, and creating an environment for justice where we don't burn out.",NA,NA,NA,NA,Thank you for including me in the survey.

I try to meditate on my own but I have not been very consistent with it. When I do meditate it's either basic mindfulness of breathing (anapanasati) or metta practice. I also sometimes use the Plum Village app or try to do active meditations like mindful eating, dishwashing, walking.",No,Yes,"This doesn't fully count, I am not trained in MBSR or MSC but I took a course on mindfulness interventions that I ended up dropping and the in-class practice was based on MBSR and MBCT.",No,NA,Yes,Yes,"I like High Park and Brick Works.

Meant for people in 20s and 30s.,Cog sci and BPMH are both interdisciplinary so it's almost necessarily collaborative. I'm still a student so I can't speak much on what it's like to work in the field. Sometimes I find it hard to get involved in research without a foot in the door (or even with).,"One of my profs like to talk about experimental competition and theoretical debate a lot. Maybe that's not what the question meant. Cog sci feels competitive in the intellectual way, psychology feels competitive in the sense that I can't get an RA position because there's so many students, BPMH feels less competitive and more open in general","Both me and one of my profs who was in my group had feelings about how the retreat is not a conference - relief of not having to try to impress everyone the whole time, and also anxiety/impatience of really wanting to jump in or follow up during/after Dharma talks and learning to just listen. Someone else described it as a conference hidden inside a retreat whereas mind and life events are like retreats hidden inside conferences. Overall I really appreciated the way people approach each other at Plum Village, like there's a baseline of kindness and openness just because we're in Plum Village.",NA,NA,I love my program but otherwise I have a pretty strongly negative view of the world I live in. It's cruel and it makes no sense at all and I'm too young to be this exhausted. Nothing feels stable or secure and it keeps getting worse. I think my research is important but I need a lot more money to do more school if I want to do it as a career and until then I need a job and the job market stinks. And I don't even need to look outside Ontario to be pissed off at the government for serving corporations at the expense of everyone else. So there's that.,"Being a student is expensive. That's the biggest one. Not sure that my other challenges are relevant to research/academia specifically. I seem to get along better with some of my professors than most people my age and I find it hard to make friends. Time management and/or mental health is almost always the limiting factor in terms of academic success. I'm very good at thinking (or so I've been told), it's everything else that's hard. Keeping myself alive and well and all that.","The same as I said in the pre-retreat survey. Someone at the retreat (a prof) told me enthusiastically that I should publish, which was encouraging. And a different prof shared about side gigs and no tenure which makes me feel less alone but also kind of disappointing to know that financially it doesn't really get better if I pursue a career in academics. Like it's doable but the university does not seem to value its people as much as it should and it's not the most stable income. I feel like I have come home to all the same problems I had before I left (it was more than seven days as I travelled a little after the retreat), which is not surprising. I've been depressed for a while and the retreat helped and I'm really glad I went but I need ongoing support and I'm not sure Wake Up or even talk therapy is going to cut it. Not exactly what the question asked but if this is generally how I feel then this is also how it feels like trying to work. I will say I feel less alone after hearing people's questions and struggles with work, along the lines of ""I care about my work but it's hard to get paid consistently"" or ""my work is really cool but how do I make sure it's ethical.""",NA,"The one I shared with my group was that I have been really struggling to believe that non-suffering isn't some kind of bullshit that we just make up to cope with how real and pervasive suffering is, and I do still struggle with this but talking to one of the monks who used to be a lot like me (stubborn, analytic, straying on the edge of nihilism) was really impactful, and the story shared with the Toronto group about the history of Plum Village was quite impactful as well. Makes me have a little more hope/faith in transformation knowing that a place that used to feel cursed now has this sense of peace that feels very real and alive. That's not what I said to my group, I used different examples.",I remember a guest lecturer before the retreat telling me that compassion fatigue isn't really compassion and that didn't really seem fair to me but I think I get what she was saying now. Listening to the joys or struggles of others doesn't really make my pain better or worse but I feel less like I'm drowning in it. Some people were going through really hard stuff and I was just glad to be there with them. You'd think trauma-dumping would be a risk with dharma sharing but it didn't really feel like that. I especially appreciated hearing from this one woman who was going through something really difficult the last (or first) time she was at Plum Village and was doing much better now. Joked about how she could actually see the individual bamboo stalks because before she was crying so much that it was all a blur. It was funny.,"I'm still thinking about how Br. Phap Linh answered someone's question saying that engaged Buddhism and practicing peace are the same thing and about trusting peace. I find it really hard to believe him but I want to.  The perspective I've been developing anyway is I think we need to let go of the idea of ""saving"" the planet (whether it's about climate change or other issues) and realize that we are in deep shit and the only thing that matters is taking care of each other and to stop making it worse wherever possible. It feels a little like giving up but it's really not. It's a subtle thing to be at peace with the way things are and to want to change them. I don't think I'm very good at it yet.",NA,NA,NA,"I have ADHD and my anxiety has been through the roof these last few months. I've also been very sad, for one specific reason but also in general. Might be relevant for the post-survey later. Looking forward to the retreat.","Unrelated to the point of the survey, but if the results of this are shared in some way with volunteers/organizers - one thing that would make me feel safer if I came back to Plum Village (which I would really like to do at some point) is to please make the ingredients more clear for meals. They were listed once or twice but not most days and I had to keep double-checking with the kitchen staff to find out which food has ingredients I am severely allergic to. I know they can't accommodate allergies and that's fine but consistently listing ingredients would be really helpful! Especially with bigger retreats I imagine there are other people with the same issue. Sometimes they would mark what had gluten but not what had peanuts and peanuts are a pretty common allergy. Otherwise the food was really good.",NA

I still struggle in creating opportunities for collaboration because I don't have enough funding to form a consistent team in my workplace. But I already found myself approaching team meetings differently, feeling more confident and at ease with sharing what's in my heart, bringing my full self and seeing the full self of those I'm with. I feel more committed to finding and creating contexts where collaboration is the pathway forward in all we build - because we are made of each other, we are not alone, we are not separate. Our work needs to reflect this. How we do our work matters as much as what we do. How we collaborate needs to reflect the peace, well-being, and loving world we hope to create.

The combination of Dharma teachings, Dhaarma sharing, science panels, and engagement in mindfulness practice throughout the retreat allowed me to have a clearer felt sense of how we construct reality. I am no longer sure I know 'who I am' and that's (I think) a good thing. I feel more open, more curious, and more willing to have a beginner's mind as I approach and co-create reality.","The retreat really highlighted for me the ways I struggle with self-compassion and how that reverberates in my relationships. I was challenged to face the parts of me who are hard on myself, while also I was invited to practice real self-compassion, embrace the emotions that flow through me with gentleness and patience. To be fully present with an emotion so it lives its full cycle and not resist it. Deep down, I hoped the retreat would teach me skills or ways to expand my own capacity to feel pain and be able to be resilient - and I actually think that deepening my capacity to be more mindful and present is allowing me to expand my capacity to 'be with pain' and not run away from it, not be scared, to let it unveil the love hidden inside. Resiliency doesn't need to be about 'being tough' as my parents taught me; it can be about 'being soft and permeable' - the softer I am, the least likely I'll break when I fall.","The retreat reinforced my understanding of how global challenges live through us; how the destruction of the planet and each other is inevitably felt in my own being and I emulate its energy if I am not mindful. Although I cannot affect large change as much as I wish I could, I can shift how I move through the world, how I allow myself to be present with how it affects me so I don't get stuck in fear and despair, how I show up in my relationships with myself and others, and in my work around ecological grief and climate action. Global challenges may be difficult to solve, but peace can live in me and through me, and I can truly find a way of feeling and embodying joy and happiness for myself and others. I can create the future I yearn for in the present through my relationships. We live in a beautiful world. It is heartbreaking that we are destroying it. And we don't need to give up in loving it and protecting it through our small lives and our small actions. Big things are made of little things. And anything is possible.

I need to get better at collaboration. As move into my publishing project it looks like bringing in very different thinkers into my calls. It looks like bringing on a designer and trusting him. It looks like, when I come across people whose work I wish I had done, sending them a note and asking them to contribute to the magazine.

For more technical projects, it looks like me and a collaborator with a clear idea of the thing we're trying to build, standing in front of a white board and drawing diagrams together that captures the idea. It often looks like two of us at one keyboard writing the code as a pair.","Caveat: I'm changing fields.

Competition looks like me seeing people publishing ideas in a similar space to what I'm thinking about and getting a sense of urgency, and a desire to ""own"" the conversation for fear that others will either get credit for work I'm also doing, or perhaps worse, steer the conversation to places I don't want it to go.

My new field is kind of self-directed creative work that I'm discovering/creating as I go. Collaboration feels like a mix right now of very intimate soul-connected discussion with my closest collaborator and then somewhat more arms length with contributors to the project. I feel a desire to ""thicken"" those relationships, however, and make this feel like we're entering a shared world together.","Competitive energy makes me uncomfortable so I've tended to avoid engaging with those aspects of my industries. In the tech industry it shows up the most in terms of the general feeling that you're in a race against competing companies, which leads to a kind of constant sprinting energy.

In my new field of creative publishing / world-building competition is a bit more of a feeling of ""what if the worlds someone else is creating take over"" or ""what if someone else creates the world I'm trying to create and does it better than me?""",It often feels a bit crammed in between childcare responsibilities. I'm also discovering what my work is since I'm redefining it.,"I've always felt like I lose my creativity and curiousity as I try to understand what institutions want from me, so I've had some interest in figuring out how to do independent research.

The core teachings may be universal, but the expression and embodiment of those teachings often vary significantly across cultures.

For example, in Plum Village, it’s particularly interesting to witness how the different monastic backgrounds contribute to the life of the community. You can feel the subtle influence of Vietnamese, French, and Western traditions coexisting and enriching the atmosphere. Each culture brings its own rhythm, values, and ways of relating.

When I spent time in Thailand, I noticed that some monks smoked or engaged in practices that would be considered unthinkable in other countries. In Japan, I’ve seen Zen monks who are married, run temples as family businesses, and even drink alcohol, something that might surprise those used to a more ascetic image of monastic life.

These cultural nuances don’t necessarily contradict the Dharma; instead, they reflect how teachings are rooted in the soil of each society. As someone with a background in both management and mindfulness, I find this intersection deeply compelling.

However I keep remembering myself to arrive with every step wherever I go. This  I especially do when going to the washroom or using public transport.

There is the book ""Happy Teacher change the world"". With Pavel and all the other people I feel like the topic of ""Happy Designer change the world"" is beginning to role. As researcher and designer we have a responsibility to be happy. How can we offer freedom if we are not free ourselves? 
The research & design process itself must be offering space for healing, happiness and joy. And putting that into a holistic model the time before, in between and after the work has to be the same. 
So I am seeing a group of people starting to collaborate on creating spaces where we can live and create mindfully, embodying the practice. We can offer this space to anyone interested. 

Another point is the specific topic of not just embodying the practice and offering spaces (Tech Sangha & Mindful Research & Design Retreats) but also focusing on what feels to be the most important topic to me. Most people use the phone in the daily life. How is the phone shaping us? How would a phone & ethical guidelines around daily tech consumption look like?

And that my reality is created top-down. The importance of beliefs. I feel like this gives me more understanding from a scientific viewpoint of the nature of my struggles. 
And also: bringing the ""work space"" (scientists) into PV was quite an interesting experience. I noticed these energies, triggering certain patterns of mine (e.g. having to show up, look professional). And throughout the week learning to befriend with that reaction and come back to more relaxed state of mind was healing. Through this connection I feel like I have more compassion for myself and more understand of what helps me to stay balanced in daily life. E.g. what my needs for sleep, movement, spiritual practice are and that I don't need to wonder if one of them is lacking for some while.","I think I shared my perspective in the previous answers. It did not really change but maybe become clearer, especially in regards to my scientific & business career. 
Following ""there is no way to peace, peace is the way"", I am aware that I do not sacrifice my happiness, joy, ..., in the present moment for something in the future. It is my responsibility to practice deeply right here, right now. And given the fact that everyone has to start with themselves and within, global challenges have to be addressed on an individual level. A big portion in the world (I belief it is 30-50%, see Growing Up/Integral theory by Ken Wilber) are at a rational (socio-centric) worldview or higher, or in other words people who trust (maybe too much, e.g. scientific materialism) it is important what the message is being sent out by the scientific community. And to the rest of the world what kind of products & services are being offered. 
We have to start within. In our own community. Bringing in balancing practices with skillful means. And from then on it will ripple outwards by itself. I have no doubt. Love is the answer. And mindfulness is the path to allowing my inherent unbound capacity for love to radiate.

I think the retreat was very successful in the former -- there was a lot of support from the monastics in developing our mindfulness practices, and a lot of time to engage in practice.  I very much needed this for my own growth and was glad to experience it. I am less sure if the second goal was met.  I did meet a few other scientists, but in my experience fewer that half the attendees were scientists (or even in related fields like engineering).  Most people I met wanted a retreat and to have time at Plum Village, and they didn't really care what the topic was.  I was heartened that a few of the people who said they came to the retreat with negative thoughts about science shared that their views of science and scientists had improved.  The first two days was all on core buddhism (which I liked!) but I was left wondering when the science would start.  I enjoyed the panels on days 3 and 5 on science, but there wasn't a chance to get to discuss science or meet other scientists unless I happened to bump into them.  I couldn't even recognize who the invited speakers were until after their panels -- no introductions were made on the first day and no name tags were worn (which overall is good for a retreat -- focusing on names and status isn't good on retreat -- but it made things difficult for networking).  I was curious whether there were other neuroscientists present, but had no way to find out other than walking around asking everyone ""are you a neuroscientist?"" which didn't seem like it would be very polite!  There was an affinity group on consciousness and the brain, but I was the only scientist who showed up for it.  I felt there were possibly lost opportunities -- I may be doing some work with mindfulness in the upcoming years, but had no place to discuss it or way to figure out who to discuss it with.  I was also hoping going into the retreat to reflect on how buddhism and mindfulness could make me a better scientist -- more open minded, etc.  In conclusion, I went into the retreat hoping for a week of mindfulness as my primary goal, and hoping to potentially gain insights about my work as a scientist and meet others in similar areas of science with common interests as my secondary goal.

Second one: Monastic life at Plum Village is a little more rebellious to old traditions, maybe a little more joyful and energetic than I thought. I liked that a lot. I wasn't sure what to expect.

Third thing, and this is connected to my first point... If we spend most of the time alone, contemplating, no one is challenging us. We need time alone (I need a lot of time alone)... But sometimes it can alienate you even from yourself, you might grow thoughts that are not true and know one proves you wrong because no-one is there to do so. That was my biggest take away.

By that I also mean, maybe not even appreciating the peace and the assets you have in life. Becoming too attached to your own problems. Having an open eye, two open eyes is important. The retreat showed me the importance of facing war and difficult global circumstances by meeting people from different backrounds and trying to look at them, be with them.
