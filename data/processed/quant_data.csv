Noticing tension and where my breath is at. I start to follow it. Mostly I cannot maintain concentration in daily life. That's why I am adding formal practices. I do sitting meditation, preferably in the mornings, after lunch and in the evenings. Length varies. I rarely do formal walking meditation. However I keep remembering myself to arrive with every step wherever I go. This  I especially do when going to the washroom or using public transport. I do diary almost every day, mostly in the evening. And mostly I do Yoga or QiGong in the mornings to deepen the connection of the body-mind. 
Sometimes after my practices (yes this can also mean after a beautiful walk to the toilet) I feel the openness for prayer.
